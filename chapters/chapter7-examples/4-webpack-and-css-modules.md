## Webpack with CSS Modules

You can use Webpack to namespace your CSS classes, which essentially means creating local scopes for your selectors. For example, if you have two components, a button and an input, no longer would you have to worry about naming your classes. You can simply name your selector and it would only apply to your given component. Now the downside is that this works in JavaScript and would not work in the pure CSS world. This is perfect when working with Angular directives or React components.
